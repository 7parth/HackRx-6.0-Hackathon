This was distinct from Grimaldi, who believed in wave-based spreading of light without any force-based interaction (Page 14).", "Newton’s theories on light and color, published through the Royal Society, triggered opposition from scientists like Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens who favored the wave theory. The backlash made Newton retreat from public debates and regret publishing his optical ideas prematurely (Page 15).", "Newton used Kepler’s laws—especially the law of areas and harmonic law—to deduce that the gravitational force must be proportional to the inverse square of the distance. This reasoning supported the conclusion that planets orbit in ellipses under such a force (Page 22).", "The method of fluxions (Newton’s version of calculus) was crucial to the Principia, but its publication was delayed because Newton feared controversy. He ultimately embedded the method indirectly through geometrical lemmas, avoiding direct reference in the main text (Page 19).", "Newton’s remark 'I frame no hypotheses' revealed his insistence on relying solely on empirical data and mathematical proof, refusing to speculate on unseen mechanisms like the cause of gravity. This statement embodied his empirical and anti-metaphysical scientific philosophy (Page 27).","Newton’s small reflecting telescope, using mirrors, corrected the chromatic aberration that plagued refracting telescopes. This innovation made telescopes more compact and accurate, earning Newton immediate recognition from the Royal Society (Page 13).", "Newton’s appointment to the Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge was pivotal, giving him a platform and independence to explore advanced topics like optics. This role supported key experiments with prisms that led to his theory of light and color (Page 12).", " In the Principia's preface, Newton emphasized the superiority of geometrical methods over mechanical ones, favoring mathematical rigor over speculative causes. He believed geometrical proofs offered clarity and objectivity in natural philosophy (Page 20).", "Newton combined empirical evidence such as comet motion and tides with mathematical models in Book III of the Principia, using this fusion to justify universal gravitation. His methodology turned isolated observations into a coherent universal law (Page 25).", " Newton initially wrote Book III in a more accessible style to reach broader audiences, but later revised it into a more mathematical structure. This made the work scientifically robust but less readable to non-specialists (Page 25)."]

Reset limit is the full sum insured plus CB post-renewal. Eligibility for bonus/resets isn’t disrupted by splitting/merging. Critical: Confirm with insurer for administrative treatment during transfer; policy wording is silent on special transitions.",
        "Direct Answer: Organ donor expenses are covered only for inpatient hospitalisation of the donor, limited to the policy sum insured plus any CB/reset, subject to an overall cap of ₹10 lakhs. Excluded are donor’s pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses, screening/testing charges, organ transportation or preservation, complications after harvesting, and cost of acquisition. Transplants deemed experimental/investigational are also excluded. Critical: The transplant must comply with the Transplantation of Human Organs Act. (Ref: Donor Expenses, pg. within Base Cover) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",

At renewal, co‑payments and deductibles reset to original defaults. Waiting‑periods (e.g., for specific diseases) are applied afresh post‑renewal and must be served before co‑payment waivers or benefits apply. Critical: Reset benefit restores sum insured—but doesn’t alter waiting‑periods or co‑payment structure.",

Only once per incident; inter‑hospital transfers or transport to home after discharge aren’t covered. Provider must be licensed, and claim is valid only if inpatient treatment is admitted. Critical: Must abide by “nearest hospital” requirement; out‑of‑India services and non‑emergency transfers are excluded. (Ref: Air Ambulance Cover section) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}",

Specific waiting periods (e.g., for listed illnesses or pre‑existing conditions) run concurrently—not consecutively—and are applied before enhancements take effect. Adding enhancements doesn’t void the base waiting‑period; coverage for newly added features begins post waiting‑periods regardless of earlier disease overlaps. Critical: Enhancements and base curriculums maintain separate waiting‑period timelines.",

Cashless only via empanelled providers; otherwise prior approval needed for reimbursement. Excluded: AYUSH or non‑allopathic treatments.

Example: Sum insured ₹10L, CB/reset pushes available to ₹12L. A robotic surgery claim of ₹5L + ₹1L pre + ₹1L post = ₹7L; within limits. If sub‑limit for robotics is ₹6L, ₹6L is max reimbursable for that item; pre/post hospitalisation costs come out of remaining ₹6L after robotics deduction.

Claim forms, hospital reports, treatment bills, diagnostic reports required, plus any co‑payment/deductible proofs. Service guarantees (like claim turnaround) and interest/penalties for delays are as per IRDAI norms and insurer’s SLA. Critical: Timeliness of document submission is mandatory; delays may lead to deduction. (This policy wording references standard procedure; actual interest rates/penalties are in annexures/ITR).",

Covered on cashless or reimbursement basis with written prescribing doctor advice. Excluded: pre‑/post‑hospitalisation, admissions for evaluation or investigation only. Critical: Must be registered AYUSH institution; admission solely for evaluation/investigation isn’t eligible. (Ref: In‑Patient AYUSH Hospitalisation section) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}",

Carry‑forward is allowed until policy break or expiry; if policy is lapsed or broken, points are forfeited.
