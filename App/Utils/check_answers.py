This was distinct from Grimaldi, who believed in wave-based spreading of light without any force-based interaction (Page 14).", "Newton’s theories on light and color, published through the Royal Society, triggered opposition from scientists like Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens who favored the wave theory. The backlash made Newton retreat from public debates and regret publishing his optical ideas prematurely (Page 15).", "Newton used Kepler’s laws—especially the law of areas and harmonic law—to deduce that the gravitational force must be proportional to the inverse square of the distance. This reasoning supported the conclusion that planets orbit in ellipses under such a force (Page 22).", "The method of fluxions (Newton’s version of calculus) was crucial to the Principia, but its publication was delayed because Newton feared controversy. He ultimately embedded the method indirectly through geometrical lemmas, avoiding direct reference in the main text (Page 19).", "Newton’s remark 'I frame no hypotheses' revealed his insistence on relying solely on empirical data and mathematical proof, refusing to speculate on unseen mechanisms like the cause of gravity. This statement embodied his empirical and anti-metaphysical scientific philosophy (Page 27).","Newton’s small reflecting telescope, using mirrors, corrected the chromatic aberration that plagued refracting telescopes. This innovation made telescopes more compact and accurate, earning Newton immediate recognition from the Royal Society (Page 13).", "Newton’s appointment to the Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge was pivotal, giving him a platform and independence to explore advanced topics like optics. This role supported key experiments with prisms that led to his theory of light and color (Page 12).", " In the Principia's preface, Newton emphasized the superiority of geometrical methods over mechanical ones, favoring mathematical rigor over speculative causes. He believed geometrical proofs offered clarity and objectivity in natural philosophy (Page 20).", "Newton combined empirical evidence such as comet motion and tides with mathematical models in Book III of the Principia, using this fusion to justify universal gravitation. His methodology turned isolated observations into a coherent universal law (Page 25).", " Newton initially wrote Book III in a more accessible style to reach broader audiences, but later revised it into a more mathematical structure.

            "Direct: Cumulative Bonus (CB) and Reset Benefit behave differently for floater and individual policies. If a floater policy splits into individual ones, the CB is divided in proportion to the sum insured of each new policy. For example, a ₹20L floater split into two ₹10L individuals would allocate a ₹10L CB as ₹5L each. Conversely, if multiple individual policies merge into a floater, only the lowest CB among them is retained. Reset Benefit restores the original sum insured (up to 100%) after exhaustion due to unrelated claims but applies only once per illness per person per year. Ref: Cumulative Bonus & Reset Benefit, pg. 8–9.",
            
            "Direct: Organ donor expenses are covered only for hospitalization costs related to harvesting the organ, and only if the insured person has a valid inpatient treatment claim. Coverage excludes any donor’s pre-hospitalization or post-hospitalization costs, screening, experimental transplants, or donor complications after the surgery. Costs such as organ acquisition, transport, and preservation are also excluded. The maximum coverage for donor-related claims is ₹10L, even if the sum insured is higher. Ref: Donor Expenses, pg. 6–7.",
            
            "Direct: A mandatory 50% base co-payment applies to all admissible claims unless the insured opts for a voluntary deductible (e.g., 20% of SI), in which case base co-pay is waived. Zone-based co-pays may also apply based on treatment geography. If the co-pay is reduced during renewal (e.g., from 50% to 30%), new waiting periods start for the reduced portion. This interaction ensures cost-sharing continues and resets only apply if a valid inpatient/daycare claim exhausts the coverage. Ref: Co-payment, Deductibles, pg. 12, 15.",
            
            "Direct: Air ambulance is covered only for life-threatening emergencies when immediate transport is needed, and road transport isn’t viable. It must be prescribed in writing by a doctor, and the provider must be licensed by a government authority. Coverage is limited to transport within India and only to the nearest emergency care facility. It excludes inter-hospital transfers, return home transport, and overseas evacuation. Claims are valid only if the related inpatient treatment is covered. Ref: Air Ambulance, pg. 11.",
            
            "Direct: Waiting periods are layered as follows: (1) Initial 30-day period for all treatments (except accidents), (2) 24/48 months for specific and pre-existing conditions. If the policy is renewed with enhancements or structural changes (like copay adjustments), waiting periods restart for the modified portion. For overlapping conditions (e.g., a listed disease that is also pre-existing), the longer applicable waiting period is enforced unless continuity is maintained. Ref: Waiting Periods, pg. 3–4, 12.",

However, several common conditions like asthma, diabetes, and hypertension are excluded. Home care treatment is separate and only allowed on a cashless basis through empanelled providers. It needs prior insurer approval, daily monitoring records, and doctor’s prescription. If no approved provider is available locally, reimbursement is allowed only with pre-approval. Ref: Domiciliary & Home Care, pg. 7–8.",
            
            "Direct: High-cost procedures like cancer treatment, cardiovascular surgeries, robotic surgeries, etc., have sub-limits even if the overall sum insured is high. For example, a policy with ₹20L SI has a ₹2L–₹5L cap for robotic surgeries depending on the treatment. These caps include pre- and post-hospitalization costs related to that condition. Even if a person undergoes multiple hospitalizations in the year, these sub-limits apply cumulatively for each listed procedure. Ref: Sub-Limits, pg. 10.",
            
            "Direct: For cashless claims, treatment must be taken at a network hospital and pre-authorization must be obtained. For reimbursement claims, the insured must submit all documents—including claim forms, prescriptions, bills, and reports—within 30 days. The insurer is legally bound to settle claims within 30 days after receipt of all documents, failing which they must pay interest. Cashless facility is not guaranteed at non-network providers. Ref: Claims Process, pg. 2–3, 10.",
            
            "Direct: AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) hospitalization is covered if the treatment is availed at an approved AYUSH hospital or daycare center. The center must be registered and have inpatient beds, therapy sections, and AYUSH practitioners. However, coverage excludes pre/post-hospitalization expenses and any expenses incurred purely for evaluation or investigations. Both cashless and reimbursement claims are possible, subject to hospital eligibility. Ref: AYUSH Treatment, pg. 8.",
            
            "Direct: Wellness points are earned via preventive health check-ups, yoga/meditation, or achieving step goals. Each point is worth ₹0.20 and can be redeemed on diagnostic tests, medicines, health services, and wellness products via the insurer’s mobile app. Maximum value is ₹600/year (3000 points). Points can be carried forward up to 3 years with continuous renewal. If the policy lapses, points must be used within 3 months or they expire. No cash conversion is allowed.

The Supreme Court in the Sabarimala case emphasized that constitutional morality prevails over traditional customs. Ref: Equality & Religious Rights, pg. 11.",
